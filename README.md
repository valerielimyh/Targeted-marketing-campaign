Targeted customers engagement 
==============================

Telemarketing is a strategy marketers commonly use to promote products or services to customers because it is more cost effective than conducting roadshows. Banks, too often adopt telemarketing. But, this pool of customers may be too huge and contacting all of them is extremely resource intensive and inefficient. Hence, if banks can find out who among this pool of customers are more likely to subscribe, and target them, banks can stretch their marketing expenses to the fullest, which in turn increase sales revenue and thus profits.

Future work:
- Among those who subscribed, how do u ensure they would not be exhausted from frequent/lengthy engagement (i.e. avoid customer fatigue)
